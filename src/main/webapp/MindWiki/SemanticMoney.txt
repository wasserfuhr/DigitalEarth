This MindPaper describes the implementation of SemanticMoney for the PieschenBank (pronounce: "Peach'nbank", NamedAfter the DiStrict OtPieschen in the CityOfDresden).
The PieschenBank is a virtual bank for the SemanticWeb based MicroNation NooPolis.
CitiZens of NooPolis are identified by their RealName.
In order to support a NameChange after marriage, CitiZens are identified by their life-long MindId.

One of the special requirements and opportunities of the PieschenBank is the complete TransParen'cy of it's data.
Therefore PieschenBank will expose it's data via a SparQl endpoint.
The data is natively stored by a MulgaraServer.
