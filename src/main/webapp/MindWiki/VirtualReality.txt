For NooPolis, we not only understand VirtualReality as a 3-dimensional simulation or AugMent'ation of RealLife, but as an (experimental) creation of entirely new levels of reality also in an organizational and institutional way.

We virtualise reality by InVent'ing rules on top of existing reality. The rules create reality games, which reflect the existing reality, but try to cut off their ComPlex'ities, in-EfFic'iencies and ParaDox'es.
