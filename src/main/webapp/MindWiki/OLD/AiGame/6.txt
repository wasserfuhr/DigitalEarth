The goal of the AiGame is to create a friendly artificial intelligence (for short: ArTelligence)
which supports Ray KurzWeil to win LongBetOne until 2029.

Inspired by the ReSearch of BenGoertzel, his company NovaMente and the AgiriWiki:AGISim, the AiGame will
* create a virtual PostReal multiuser world which is inhabited by real people and intelligent agents.
* create an economic system with it's own currency, a banking system (with learnings from SecondLife), a TradeRegister with virtual enterprises and trading of goods and services.

* Our virtual world: NooPolis
* Our currency: KayGroschen
* Our bank: PieschenBank

All this will be modeled with SemanticWeb technologies, OpenSource software, open APIs and open content.
The activities of humans and intelligent agents will governed by a virtual e-Democracy with its own ConStitution.
The players are CitiZens of a self-organizing SocialNetwork.
