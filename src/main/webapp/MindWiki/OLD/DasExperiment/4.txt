inspired by [WikiWikiWeb:ChineseRoom] and [WikiPedia:Chinese_Room].

On TimeLine:20080907:1607MEST RainerWasserfuhr started an experiment where
his __only__ interface to the UniVerse is this MindWiki.

To make it clear: You can __not__ contact RainerWasserfuhr:
* no TwittEr
* no SkyPe
* no XingLe, FaceBook, WerKenntWen EtAl
* no PoTs, no MindPhone
* MailIsDead

The only exception: TheDoor of the WirkZentrum.
BUT: TheDoor only opens, when the opening request is scheduled via MindWiki.
Everything that goes through this door has to be traced in the MindWiki.
