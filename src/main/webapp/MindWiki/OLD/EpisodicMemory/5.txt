* InterWiki: [AgiriWiki:Episodic_Memory], [WikiPedia:Episodic_memory]

TheExperiment showed: The [AgiriWiki:Memory] has to be very fluent. Of course there is some "absolute" time axis, which is focused around a standard model of time like [WikiWikiWeb:UnixTime].
Many sources of time related information have ConText's with TimeZone's and systematic time clock errors, e.g. from time series of devices. [WikiWikiWeb:DaylightSavingTime] will produce a systematic error bias.
The most important sources for EpisodicMemory:
* WikiPage's of the MindWiki, including
** ReVision's from RecentChanges
** JahrGang and LebensEnde of MindPeople
** WikiLender and WasWar
* timestamps from the DataMap (mainly DelIcioUs, TwittEr, FlickEr, FriendFeed, SeesMic, BlogLines, XingLe-InBox)
* timestamps from WebApp's (BankAccount, MindFloor)
* WikiPedia (almost only MindEvent's with a precision of one day; exact MindPlace and time must be InFer'ed from ConText)
