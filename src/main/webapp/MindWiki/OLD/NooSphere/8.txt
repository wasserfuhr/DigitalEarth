The NooSphere is a concept to describe the evolution of the future, with a time horizon towards
2040 or 2050.

In the year 2008 the evolution the NooSphere can be studied at your home: Probably you will find paper, 
pencils, books, journals, ring binders, stamps, CDs, DVDs, TV sets, houseplants, wrapping paper, punchers, paper-fasteners, board games.

In the year 2008 the evolution the NooSphere can be studied at WikiPedia: Within less than 7 years, a nucleus of common knowledge emerged that AcCelerate the oldfashioned processes of paper based science.
Projects like ScholarPedia foreshadow the new speed of scientific discovery and discourse.
NobelPrize winners start to work in realtime with the global scientific community.
Projects like DbPedia or FreeBase transform human readable hypertext into machine readable database grids.

Grid computing is on the way to become a utility. Entire clusters can be set up within minutes with a few 
scripts and a credit card.

FastForward 2050: Pain has disappeared. Fear has disappeared. Scarcity disappeared. Mortality vanished.

Duties and DeadLine's disappeared - automating any human work - completely replaced by self-assembling intelligent matter.

Each MiNd on PlanetEarth can connect to NooSphere - a system of an ExPo'nentially increasing intelligence superstructure - and being part of it.

In 2050 the NooSphere will be a system of SelfImprove'ing algorithms operated on a global neuro-quant-silicio cluster with 5 yottaflops, doubling every 24 months.

ConScious'ness has become an inter-personal and TransHuman phenomenon.
