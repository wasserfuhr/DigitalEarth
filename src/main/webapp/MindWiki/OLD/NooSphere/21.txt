Inspired by TeilhardDeChardin, the NooSphere is the ProjectCodeName for a WikiBased multiplayer online game to InVent scenarios for the future, with a time horizon UnTil2100 and beyond. The NooSphere is a HardScienceFiction novel, where you can be both an author and actor to shape your and our future.
The NooSphere is created by RainerWasserfuhr and the CitiZens of NooPolis.

At the center of the NooSphere is NooPolis, our WikiBased digital MicroNation. It defines the rules (→ ConStitution) and the players (→ CitiZens).

Additionally, our WikiBased UniVerse consists of:
* The MindWiki
* The MindMap with hundreds of MindPlace's
* other MindPeople, who might not yet be CitiZens of NooPolis
* RealLife-MindEvent's for ConnectingBeautifulMinds
* The FutureMap with dozens of FutureCard's, describing advanced scenarios for the TwentyFirstCentury
