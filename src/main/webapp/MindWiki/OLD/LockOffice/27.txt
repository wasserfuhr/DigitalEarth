The interim CoWorkingSpace of LockSchuppenAg at LouisenStrasse in the NeuStadt of the CityOfDresden.

The LockOffice is THE connecting hub, built as a creative CoWorkingSpace, where EntrePreneur's, DeSign'ers, ProGram'mers, ReSearch'er and other people interested in collaborative ways of working can meet.

Office and community space for EntrePreneur's on hourly, daily and monthly basis are provided. Facilities for WorkShop's and CoLearning (web and IT tools making collaborative work more effective and relaxing).

Check out [TwittEr:LockSchuppen] and [Hallenprojekt|http://www.hallenprojekt.de/lockschuppen] whether we are in and drop in.

Still in an early stage, awaiting visitors and so BrainStorm'ing has started. New ideas __1‰ of LockSchuppenAg shares__ will be provided (you need to become CitiZen of NooPolis which is the virtual community powering this webspace)

Recent ideas can be found on our WikiWall and will be updated daily. Please send in your ideas via [TwittEr:LockSchuppen] with HashTag #LockOffice. Your cards will be marked then adequately.
