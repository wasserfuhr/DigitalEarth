''' Der Interims-CoWorkingSpace der LockSchuppenAg auf der LouisenStrasse in der NeuStadt der StadtDresden: LockOfficeAnfahrt'''

The interim CoWorkingSpace of LockSchuppenAg at LouisenStrasse in the NeuStadt of the CityOfDresden.

The LockOffice is THE connecting hub, built as a creative CoWorkingSpace in StadtDresden, where EntrePreneur's, DeSign'ers, ProGram'mers, ReSearch'er and other people interested in collaborative work ways can meet.

This is the future location we are working on to re-furbish and -use as the FutureLab2056:

Office and community space for EntrePreneur's on hourly, daily and monthly basis are provided. Facilities for WorkShop's and CoLearning (web and IT tools making collaborative work more effective and relaxing).
