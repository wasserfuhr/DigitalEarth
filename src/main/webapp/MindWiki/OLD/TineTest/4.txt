inspired by [this idea|http://dwave.wordpress.com/2008/08/30/immortality/] from GeordieRose:

The TineTest is an extension of the TuringTest.
Soon we will once a year put ChristineSchlinck behind one of two magic semipermeable curtains.

A TestPerson will sit in front of the two magic curtains.
By ZuFall'sgenerator, ChristineSchlinck will be put behind one of the curtains.

The TestPerson will now talk simultaneously to
* the __real__ ChristineSchlinck__, and
* an immersive 3D AvaTar-simulation of ChristineSchlinck, with synthetic voice and animated face and body movements

At the end of 25 minutes, the test person has to decide, behind which curtain
the __real__ ChristineSchlinck__ was.
