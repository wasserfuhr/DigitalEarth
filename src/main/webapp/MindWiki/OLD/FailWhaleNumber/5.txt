The FailWhaleNumber is a little DegreesOfSeparation game similar to the ErdosNumber, BaconNumber or TurkNumber:


The FailWhale number is defined as follows:
* JackDorsey CEO and MindOne of TwittEr has FailWhaleNumber 0
* the __first 100 followers__ of JackDorsey have FailWhaleNumber 1 (TwittEr shows exactly the 100 first followers on a profile page)
* the __first 100 followers__ of somebody with FailWhaleNumber 1 has FailWhaleNumber 2
* etc etc.
