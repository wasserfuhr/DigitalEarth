Die Potentiale persönlicher Wikis als sanfte evolutionäre Zwischenstufe hin zum globalen BlueMind sind bei weitem noch nicht ausgeschöpft. Deshalb: MindMe.

Transscript from PieschenTv:
Let me try to talk a little bit about ArtificialIntelligence:
As you might know I have a wiki. I use this wiki to store
almost any aspect of my life. The wiki is a JspWiki.
There is a nice feature which is called CamelCase.
Anybody who knows the wiki of WardCunningham
will also know what CamelCase is and will also
appreciate this way of linking between WikiPage's.
I really got addicted to this way of using a wiki.
There is an interesting reason why this is so exciting.
Let me try to explain. 
But why do I need a LifeWiki?
Let's look at the map of our future and any sufficiently
well informed person will know that on a time 
horizon between 2040 and 2100 there will be with suffiently
high probability something like TheSingularity with a convergence
of human and machine intelligence.
This is something I won't discuss now. This is
something that enough people already have understood.
And now I am curious how this affects my life
as of today, as of the year 2008.
For my personal situation:
I was born in the early summer of 1969.
Looking at statistics of life expectancy there are
some nice charts that show that I have a LifeExpectancy
until let's say 2045-2050.
There is a good reason to think about this stuff
and to do it now. To try to reasearch and study 
the influence of these topics on my personal life.

So I started with a wiki.
Later on I found some nice concepts.
I think it was JohnSmart who used the term DigitalTwin.
Now in the october 2008 my life wiki has about 3700 pages.
It is becoming more and more a mirror of my thoughts, of my entire
life. There are some really exciting pattern you
can observe on a day-to-day basis that my life 
is really converging with this new tool.
I can have an icecream with a freind and
to some protocol of the conversation.

Almost every 10 seconds there is some topic that 
i talk about and this topic is arealdy represetned
in the lifewiki.
This is actually what I did yesterday. He is well
informed about topics I am as well.
I can now in the year 2008 show that there
is a more and more strong convergence
between things that are written down in my
lifewiki and thoughts in my brain.
Now just look into the future, lets say five 
or ten years.
Lets assume more and more ubiquitouos devices
that will let me have my lifewiki wherever I are.
Than lets assume a tool which filters my newsreader
for keywords and matches them with topics
from my wiki. This is something I would like to develop.
