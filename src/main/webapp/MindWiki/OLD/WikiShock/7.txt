Some people not familiar with Wikis and the MindWiki report a WikiShock while reading it.

Why WikiShock? What is the barrier to start and create a digital model of our own MiNd?

Because of being confronted with
# the ComPlex'ity AND
# the finiteness of our own MiNd?

Because of not thinking about HolyData.

Because huge amounts of data require MedienKompetenz to master them. 

Because of not knowing how to use tools like DelIcioUs, BlogLines, XingLe.

Because of the IdeoLogie of PriVat'eness.

Only a WikiMind is ready for the next ShockLevel: JoinNow: __EinfachMachen__!
