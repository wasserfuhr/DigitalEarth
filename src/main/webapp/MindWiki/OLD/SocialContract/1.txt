A fundamental idea of NooPolis is the SocialContract between
it's CitiZens.

We create the SocialContract on a PeerToPeer base, from scratch, or from: a WikiBased TabulaRasa.

We do not know whether our WebOfTrust will scale beyond the current level.
We start the SocialContract from
* different economic levels, with
* different languages,
* diffent skills.
