On TimeLine:20190922:0815 RainerWasserfuhr woke up in his bed on
the 10th floor of MindTowerZwo.
It wasn't a perfect summer day. The sky in the valley of the ElbeRiver was
cloudy. He slept quite well. He lounged in the bed sheets, took on
his MindEyes and walked across the black wooden parquet into WikiTchenTwo.
BeatriceBaranov was sitting on the bar stool in her silky bathrobe and sipping from a cup 
of RondoMelange, while her long legs disturbed his attention.
RainerWasserfuhr looked at the WindowScreen, where JfSchlinck was preparing for MindSchule.
JfSchlinck was 10 years old, becoming 11 next month.
JfSchlinck was currently at BergGarten, approximately 4 kilometers away.
The WindowScreen allowed them to have an experience of being in a common room.
RainerWasserfuhr faded out the WindowScreen and switched to the RealLife 
perspective of the glass pane, which showed a beautiful GeWimmel across the AlbertPlatz. 
The whole MindTowerZwo was equipped with a 480 mbit wireless network
which radiated a free wireless service for other CitiZens in the CityOfDresden
for up to 500 meters around the building.

He wore the latest model of the MindEyes. These magical MindEyes had
a 3D positioning, which allowed RainerWasserfuhr to track his line of sight
in RealTime. When he looked at the AlbertPlatz, little green markers of
differrent size showed those people with whom he had the most intense interactions
in the last weeks. Some of them raised their hand and waved to him.
During the last 11 years, the CityOfDresden had become one of the most futuristic cities
on PlanetEarth: GoogleCity.
Together with DirkHilbert, the most visionary SingularPolitician in the
FreistaatSachsen, he has created a GuerillaMarketing event, which
caused a thunderstorm of unseen creativity among the CitiZens of the CityOfDresden.
Although nobody at OneSixZeroZeroAmphiTheatreParkway ever
had planned a project in this direction, DirkHilbert and
RainerWasserfuhr created a phantastic scenario with the help
of the DresdenFutureGroup, which finally convinced LarryAndSergey
to choose the CityOfDresden as headquarters for their SpaceLift project.
It was going to be the central hub for the extension of humanity into space.
But it started on PlanetEarth:
They built the most advanced digital model of
a city ever seen on PlanetEarth. Not only an geometric model,
but a deep semantic model of the city government, the TradeRegister
and an OptIn based DigitalTwin of the life the CitiZens.

In 2012, LarryAndSergey decided to skip LiveLy in favour of NooSphere:
Since 2015, 3.000 high potentials lived here for buildung NooSphere, the 
most advanced augmented reality system on PlanetEarth, engaging 250 million
users worldwide in a magical GlasPerlenSpiel.

The WorldSenate of NooPolis was becoming a political incarnation of a global 
citizenship and BasicIncome.

The OlPx initiative sponsored 200 million laptops for developing countries,
combined with permanent personal relationships to their sponsors.
In 2010, GoogleInc acquired XingAg for 300m EUR in order to build
the SocietoNetwork.
