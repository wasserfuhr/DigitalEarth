# Establishing a European hold of the SingularityUniversity, and provide on the same part a place where active CoWorking and -learning can take place for people to play to their strengths and shape the future (with help of technologies)
# OpenNetwork's and collaboration across boundaries
# The innovative part is the FutureLab2056, where people will experience the world of working, living and housing through VirtualReality and the chance to impose their own ideas in future MindQuest's that will lead the visitors through the FutureLab2056
# The orga structure is based on swarm-collective-intelligence from its members (in the LockSchuppen) and it adjacent networks that spread outside Saxony, Germany to all parts of the world. The scope will scale up over time, starting small (even perhaps without a building, despite the goal of establishing a physical place of learning, working in Dresden, preferrably at the LockSchuppen)
# Other networks already involved are the PresencingInstitute (founder: OttoScharmer, members: appr. 2200), Society for Organizational Learning (founder: PeterSenge, members: several thousands, including organizations like Ford, Solvay, Nokia, Shell, BP, etc.), HallenProjekt (Founder: ChristianHeller, members: 300), LeanThinking at XING (Founder: RalfLippold, members: appr. 1.200), LeanThinking at Lean Enterprise Institute (Founder: JimWomack, members: several thousand), TiimiAkatemia (Found: JohannesPartanen, members: several thousand + network of TeamMastery educated coaches around the globe), MobileBarCamp, BMW, ...
# The future uses of LockSchuppen will be a joined collaboration place in order to connect technological hubs (MitMediaLab, MIT D-Lab, MIT S-Lab, SingularityUniversity, MPI, BioTechZentrum Dresden, GlobalFoundries, QiMonda (even though they are down right now), and others to interconnect with possible users (entrepreneurs, creative minds, networks) and customers at the place LockSchuppen where innovations become living products and services in the business world and community as well as society (spanning across to other countries and fields).

While growing out of the fixed place the idea of LockSchuppen will take root in other unused buildings of DeutschBahn around DeutschLand (and old buildings alike) transforming them into vivid places of InNov'ation and CoWorking providing the innovationary and visionary space that the BauHaus (nearly 90 years ago founded in StadtWeimar) and HellerAu (founded 100 years ago in HellerAu) have seeded already :)
