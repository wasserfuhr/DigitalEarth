NoOs is a new social OperatingSystem that is based on OpenNess and a global WebOfTrust. Anything that happens on NoOs is public.

It helps to build a SocialGraph that is complementary to FaceBook TwittEr GoogleWave WindowsLiveId OpenId or YaHoo
and additionally based on WikiPedia ViAf and DbLp.

NoOs will create
* MicroNation's
* VirtualCash
* Semantics, Trust and Reasoning.

At the core we have TruePeople who act with their RealName.

You can do whatever you like in private contexts, but it is not supported by NoOs.

AppEngine offers to InfraStructure to server side SoftWare of arbitrary ComPlex'ity.

Now our task is to improve the clojure function called
"noomic" step by step. It is quite similar to
what Java developers will know as a servlet.
However, NoOs is completely dynamic.
In the 0.1 release, each admin can edit
this function and therewith determine the
behaviour of the entire platform.
So it is completely open to the initial
group of people to form a good WebOfTrust and
to establish practises like PeerReview,
testing procedures and quality assurance.


The LongTerm goal of NoOs is to create a digital model of global ConScious'ness.

Most important Motiv of the NooSphere: Based on [DeWikiPedia:Mimesis], ConScious'ness is TransForm'ed into
more and more simple SoftWare. ComPress'ed SelfModel. BeingNoOne.
