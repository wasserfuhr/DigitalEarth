NoOs is a new social OperatingSystem that is based on OpenNess and a global WebOfTrust. Anything that happens on NoOs is public.

It helps to build a SocialGraph that is complementary to FaceBook TwittEr GoogleWave WindowsLiveId OpenId or YaHoo
and additionally based on WikiPedia ViAf and DbLp.

NoOs will create
* MicroNation's
* VirtualCash
* Semantics, Trust and Reasoning.

At the core we have TruePeople who act with their RealName.

You can do whatever you like in private contexts, but it is not supported by NoOs.


AppEngine offers to InfraStructure to server side SoftWare of arbitrary ComPlex'ity.

The LongTerm goal of NoOs is to create a digital model of global ConScious'ness.

Most important Motiv of the NooSphere: Based on [DeWikiPedia:Mimesis], ConScious'ness is TransForm'ed into
more and more simple SoftWare. ComPress'ed SelfModel. BeingNoOne.
