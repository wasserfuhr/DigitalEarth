BigTableNomic is a MultiUserGame for SoftWare developers.

It is similar to a WiKi, where you can edit the pages.
But at BigTableNomic you can not only change the WikiPage's,
but you can __change the SourceCode__ of the WikiEngine itself.
So the rules of game can change dynamically, based
on the changes that developers make.
A game that allows to change it's own rules is called »NoMic«.
A game where the rules are coded in SourceCode of a WebApp is called »CodeNomic«.
 
Our CodeNomic game played on top of the functional ProgrammingLanguage CloJure, installed as a WebApp hosted on an AppEngine from GoogleInc.

For coordinating different players, we use a game currency called KayGroschen.

Our VirtualCurrency currently has CurrencyBacking of 1024 EuRo, that will be payed out by
RainerWasserfuhr in cash UnTil 2011-12-31 latest.

To play BigTableNomic, you should be familiar with
* how a WebApp on the JavaVm and on AppEngine works
* BigTable, as seen through the low level Java DataStore-API
* CloJure, as our main language

BigTableNomic is inspired by PerlNomic, but additionally it allows to create very a dynamic and scalable game inventory because of the underlying BigTable InfraStructure.

To play BigTableNomic you only need a GoogleAccount. Soon we may also support FbConnect. JoinNow and help to implement it and earn 8192 units of our game currency »KayGroschen«.

For coordinating the BigTableNomic developers we use a simple "DogFood" application that is based on the BigTable entity "BootStrap" and sorted in ReverseChronological order by property "date" and soon shown on the HomePage.

The BootStrap WebApp is

Other WebApp's based on BigTableNomic obtain their initial version from GoogleCode.

Currently BigTableNomic is played on these AppEngine WebApp's:
||ReVision||WikiPage||WebApp
|32|BigTableNomic |http://bigtablenomic.appspot.com/
|32|NooPolis      |http://noopolis.appspot.com/
|ToDo|FlavourCity |http://flavourcity.appspot.com/
|ToDo|PieschenArtGroup |http://pieschenartgroup.appspot.com/
|ToDo|PieschenBank|http://pieschenbank.appspot.com/

BigTableNomic is similar to a WiKi, but here the PageContent is not static text,
but a dynamically executable fragment of SourceCode. 
Currently BigTableNomic supports SourceCode for
* CloJure
* JavaScript (similar to Helma)
* PHP

In TheFuture we might also support server side languages like
* grails
* jRuby
* Jython
* Scala

The mid-term goal of BigTableNomic is to create
a new social OperatingSystem called »NoOs«, offering
* Identity
* Trust
* Currency
* SemanticWeb

We want to help create an ecosystem for programmers, web designers and users.
