TeilhardDeChardin: "... The Berkeley cyclotron definitively disappeared before my distracted eyes. In its place and in my imagination, was the entire NooSphere, warped by the breath of ReSearch, forming but one single, enormous cyclone, whose effect was to produce, instead of nuclear Energy, psychic Energy in an increasingly advanced state, in other words, identical to the Ultra-HuMan. Yet, the remarkable thing was that, faced with this colossal reality, which made me feel dizzy, I felt only deep calm and joy." [*|http://pagesperso-orange.fr/jacques.abbatucci/globalization.htm]"
